# Getting Started with Vite and React

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), a modern build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. Vite provides a faster and leaner development environment for modern web projects.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will hot reload when you make file changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run serve`

Locally previews the production build on a local server.
Run this after `npm run build` to view the production build on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Configuring Vite

You can customize the Vite configuration by modifying the `vite.config.js` file. Vite supports a vast range of plugins and configurations that allow you to tailor the build process to your project's needs.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

### Code Splitting

Vite supports code splitting out of the box. For more details on how to utilize this feature with React, you can refer to Vite's documentation on [building for production](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html).

### Analyzing the Bundle Size

Vite offers features to analyze the bundle size. Tools such as `rollup-plugin-visualizer` can be integrated into your Vite project to help you understand and optimize your bundle.

### Making a Progressive Web App

You can create a Progressive Web App (PWA) with Vite using the official PWA plugin. For more details, see Vite's [PWA Plugin documentation](https://vitejs.dev/plugins/pwa.html).

### Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration options, visit the [Configuring Vite](https://vitejs.dev/config/) section in the Vite documentation.

### Deployment

For information on how to deploy applications built with Vite, check out the [Deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) guide on the Vite documentation site.
